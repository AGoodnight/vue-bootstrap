# Vue Boilerplate

This is a simple website/webapp setup.

Using Vue-Router the boilerplate has multiple navigation items.
Using Vue-Bootstrap we have ready to use components and styles
Using Vuex and Vuex-PersistedState we have a global state machine that persists to local storage.

The Compiling and dev-server is handled with Webpack

Once you download the repo install the dependencies from <i>package.json</i> run ```npm start``` to get started.
